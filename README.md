# PHP/SQLite Interaction System Via Web Request

The PHP/SQLite Interaction System Via Web Request - PSWrequest is a class written in [PHP](https://www.php.net/) intended to interact with the [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/) database.

This class inherits the structure of the default [SQLite3 library](https://www.php.net/manual/pt_BR/book.sqlite3.php), so the library must be enabled for this tool to work.

The class differential is to provide simplified mechanisms of communication (requests and responses) between the database and the requestor.
